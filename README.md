# Caesar-Cipher
Caesar Cipher in C++, including spaces.

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

It's simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e. each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B.
